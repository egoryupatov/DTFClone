Hi! This is one of the apps I developed as a pet project to acquire new skills and strengthen the ones I already have.

## App description

Full-fledged blog app (frontend + backend + database). A clone of really existing blog.

## App features

The app features:

1) Authorization (JWT token)
2) Routes protection (Guards)
3) Blog post CRUD operations
4) UserContainer rating system (rating of posts and comments published by a user affects their overall rating in the profile)
5) Comments and nested comments
6) SearchContainer
7) Hidden posts (if youâ€™re logged in, you can hide posts and unhide them in the dashboard)
8) UserContainer dashboard
9) Infinity scroll of posts and comments

## Used technologies

* Language - JavaScript/TypeScript
* Front end framework/library - Next 13
* Back end framework/library - Nest.js
* State management - Redux
* CSS - SASS
* Database - PostgreSQL

## How to run the app on your local machine

First, you'll need to create a MySQL database:

1) Install and launch PostgreSQL on your local machine using your favorite way
2) Create a database with the following configuration:
    1) host: `localhost`,
    2) username: `postges`,
    3) port: `5432`,
    5) database: `blog_pg`,
3) Connect to your new database using your favorite database tool (e.g. DBeaver)
4) Create at least one record in the following tables:
    1) Category - available blog post categories
    2) Users - existing users and blog post authors
    3) Blog_post - existing blog posts (don't forget to select relations with a user and category)
    4) Comments - existing comments (don't forget to select relations with a user and blog post / you can also add relations between existing comments to create nested ones)

The second step is to start the server:

1) Navigate into the server directory
2) Install the dependencies using one of the following commands: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3) Start the server using one of the following commands: `npm start` or `yarn start`

The final step is to start the app itself:

1) Navigate into the app directory
2) Install the dependencies using one of the following commands: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3) Start the app using one of the following commands: `npm run dev`

## Authorization details

You can authorize into the application using the credentials of one of the users you added to your database in the very first step
